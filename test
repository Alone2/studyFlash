# It is defined here when a card counts as mastered and will 
# not be asked again. 
# (reset statistics to study cards again with: 'studyflash reset FILENAME')

# Syntax: A python boolean is defined
# You can use 'and' and 'or' to combine statements (see example 2)

# Parameters you can use:
# cards.timesCorrect: How many times youre answer was correct
# cards.timesIncorrect: How many times youre answer was incorrect
# cards.timesPlayed: How many times you ansered the question
# cards.streak: Youre current streak on how many times you're answer correct.

# Example 1: 
# card.streak > 2
# Explanation: Card needs to be guessed correctly more than 3 times in a row:
# for it to not appear anymore and be marked as mastered

# Example 2 ():
# card.timesCorrect > card.timesIncorrect and card.timesCorrect > 2
# Explanation: You need to have guessed the card correctly more times than you guessed it incorecctly
# and the card has to be answered correctly more than 2 times for it to not appear again.

# Example 3: 
# False
# Explanation: Never sort a card out. Every card will be asked everytime 
# even if you answered the question correctly 100x times. 

# Current configuration: You need to have a streak of more or equal to 2
# and need to have answered the question correctly at least 3 times:
card.timesCorrect > 2 and card.streak >= 2
